It is a kind of joint name of square pipe and rectangular pipe,that is,the steel pipe with equal and unequal side length,it is made of strip steel processed by technology. Generally,strip steel after unpacked,flattened,crimped,welded round pipe,then rolled into square pipe, and then cut into the required length Production process classification Of square steel pipe According to the production process,square pipe is divided into:hot rolled seamless square pipe ,cold drawn seamless square pipe, extruded square pipe without dimension, welded square pipe. The welded square pipe is divided into: (a) according to the process of an arc welded square pipe, resistance welded square pipe (high frequency, low frequency), gas welded square pipe, furnace welded square pipe (b) according to the weld of straight welded square pipe, spiral welded square pipe Square tube material classification. Square tube according to material: ordinary carbon steel square tube, low alloy square tube. General carbon steel is divided into: Q195, 0215.0235, 0275SS400, 20# steel, 45# steel, etc. : low alloy steel is divided into Q345, 16N, 0390, ST53-2, etc."

        "description": "Welded steel pipe, also known as welded pipe, is made of steel plate  or strip steel after crimping. The production process of welded steel pipe is simple, the production efficiency is higher, the cost is more lower, the product variety is getting richer, but the general strength is lower than seamless steel pipe. Welded steel pipe according to the welding process is divided into furnace welded pipe, electric welding (resistance welding) pipe and automatic arc welding pipe, according to the welding form is divided into straight seam welded pipe and spiral welded pipe, according to the end shape is divided into round welded pipe and special-shaped (square, flat, etc.) welded pipe. According to usage, it is divided into general welded pipe, galvanized welded pipe, oxygen blown welded pipe, wire bushings, metric welded pipe, roller pipe, deep well pump pipe, automobile pipe, transformer pipe, thin-wall welded pipe, special-shaped welded pipe and spiral welded pipe. Because of the different welding methods, there are different methods of producing welded steel tubes. The application of welded pipe is mainly used in boilers, automobiles, ships, light construction structure of doors and Windows steel, furniture, various agricultural machinery, scaffolding, wire pipe, high-rise shelves, containers and so on."
